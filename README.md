# Unity Machine Learning Agent

## Introduction

This is repository for **Unity Machine Learning Agent** and **Reinforcement Learning(RL)**.

Unity release awesome tool for making reinforcement learning environment! [Unity Machine Learning](https://unity3d.com/machine-learning)

I usually make 2D RL environment with [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news). [pygame environment repository](https://github.com/Kyushik/DRL)

Thanks to Unity, I am trying to make some 3D RL Environments.

I wrote summary of RL algorithms in [pygame environment repository](https://github.com/Kyushik/DRL)



Some of the environment made by purchased models. In this case, it is hard to provide raw unity codes. However, there are some simple environments which are made by simple or free model. I will provide raw unity codes for those environments if I solve the capacity problem.

## Unity ML Environments

### Vehicle Environment(Static Obstacles)

 The agent of this environment is vehicle. Obstacles are static tire barriers. If vehicle hits obstacle, it gets minus reward and game restarts. If vehicle hits start, it gets plus reward and game goes on.  The specific description of the environment is as follows.

Sample video of this game is as follows.

### Pong

This is simple and popular environment for testing deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Two bars have to hit the ball to win the game.  In my environment, left bar is `agent` and right bar is `enemy`. Enemy is invincible, so it can hit every ball.  In every episode, ball is fired in random direction.

```
The rules of the pong are as follows.
- Agent hits the ball: reward +1
- Agent misses the ball: reward -1

Terminal conditions
- Agent misses the ball
- Agent hit the ball 5 time in a row
```
